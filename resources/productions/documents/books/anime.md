          The only part I concluded differently is the ending part. The reason they don’t
          remember each other is more to do with Japanese folklore and Musubi as well.
          Remember to leave the underworld you must give what is most important to you.
          Taki went back to the shrine and drank the kuchikamisake and took back the
          offering of half of Mitsuha’s soul. In doing so he had to offer up what was most
          important to him to leave the underworld. Taki’s memories of Mitsuha. The same
          applies to her. She fell in love with Taki before she died and to return to the
          world after Taki returned her soul to her she offered up what was most important
          to her. Mitsuha’s memories of Taki. If Taki had written his name on her hand it
          would of disappeared as well because of Musubi, but he wrote I love you instead,
          which in Japanese folklore is protected by Tsukiyomi and couldn’t be touched by
          Musubi. Their happy ending plays on the motif that even though the mind cannot
          remember, the heart always will. Which comes full circle in the idea that the
          red thread of fate will always connect people no matter the circumstances, time,
          or place. Other than that you perfectly incapsulated the ideas and themes of
          this movie. Thank you for sharing!
